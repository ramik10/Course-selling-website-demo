This is a course selling website project developed by me every new thing I learn about full stack development I use in this project.

02-course-app-medium.js is the backend (command: "node index.js")
and you can find the admin backend in the 02-medium-course-selling-app-admin-dashboard/src folder and user backend in the user_react/user-react/src folder(command for both: "npm run dev")
